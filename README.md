# cybersecurity_incident_management_system

The provided code is a Python program utilizing the Tkinter library for creating a GUI application for Cybersecurity Incident Management System (CIMS). Let's break down the functionality and structure of the code:

Overview of the Code
Imports: The code imports necessary modules:

tkinter: GUI library for Python.
PIL.Image, PIL.ImageTk: Image processing libraries for Tkinter.
tkcalendar.Calendar: Calendar widget for date selection.
mysql.connector: MySQL database connector.
tkinter.messagebox: For displaying message boxes.
Class Definition (CC):

The main class CC initializes the GUI (root) and sets its geometry, title, and icon.
It defines various instance variables (StringVar objects) to store user input for different fields related to cybersecurity incidents.
GUI Layout:

Title and Logos: Displays the title "Cybersecurity Incident Management System" and two logos on top of the window.
Frames and Images: Utilizes frames and images to structure and enhance the GUI layout.
Input Fields: Creates multiple entry fields (ttk.Entry) for users to input details related to a cybersecurity incident such as case ID, victim details, date of incident, etc.
Radio Buttons and Option Menu: Provides radio buttons (Radiobutton) for selecting gender and an option menu (OptionMenu) for selecting the status of the incident.
Buttons: Includes buttons (Button) for operations like save, update, delete, and clear.
Calendar Integration: Uses tkcalendar.Calendar to select the date of the incident.
Search and Display Area: Implements functionality for searching records based on case ID, IP address, or status. Displays records in a ttk.Treeview widget.
Table View: Displays fetched records in a table (ttk.Treeview) with columns representing different attributes of the incident.
Database Operations:

Save Data (save_data): Validates user input and saves the incident data to a MySQL database (cims_data).
Get Data (get_data): Fetches all records from the database and populates them into the table (ttk.Treeview).
Update Data (update_data): Updates selected record in the database after user confirmation.
Get Cursor (get_cursor): Retrieves data from the selected row in the table and populates corresponding entry fields for editing/viewing.
Search Data (search_data): Searches for records based on user-specified criteria (case ID, IP address, status).
Error Handling and Notifications:

Displays appropriate error messages (messagebox.showerror) for mandatory fields and database operation failures.
Shows success messages (messagebox.showinfo) for successful database operations.
Database Connection:

Connects to a MySQL database (localhost with username root and password mysql) using mysql.connector.
Detailed Explanation
The code defines a comprehensive GUI application using Tkinter and integrates it with MySQL for storing and retrieving cybersecurity incident data. It employs various widgets like Label, Entry, Radiobutton, OptionMenu, Button, Treeview, and Scrollbar to create a user-friendly interface. The application allows users to manage cybersecurity incidents by adding, updating, deleting, searching, and viewing records. It handles user input validation and provides feedback through message boxes.

Overall, this code serves as a functional example of a GUI-based Cybersecurity Incident Management System in Python, demonstrating basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with a MySQL database.
